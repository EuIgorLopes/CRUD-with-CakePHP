A skeleton for creating applications with [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org) 4.x.

The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

## Installation

Afther you clone the project, run the next comand for donwload the dependences of CakePHP.

```bash
composer create-project
```

Create a copy of .env and app_local.php

```bash
cd config
cp .env.example .env
cp app_local.example.php app_local.php
```

Create an empty database for your project using. 
In .env and app_local.php config your databese and default values

Run the next comand in root of your project to create the tables in database

```bash
bin/cake migrations migrate
```

You can now either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start
up the built-in webserver with:

```bash
bin/cake server -p 8765
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8765` to see the welcome page.

## Update

Since this skeleton is a starting point for your application and various files
would have been modified as per your needs, there isn't a way to provide
automated upgrades, so you have to do any updates manually.

## Configuration

Read and edit the environment specific `config/app_local.php` and setup the 
`'Datasources'` and any other configuration relevant for your application.
Other environment agnostic settings can be changed in `config/app.php`.

## Layout

The app skeleton uses [Milligram](https://milligram.io/) (v1.3) minimalist CSS
framework by default. You can, however, replace it with any other library or
custom styles.
